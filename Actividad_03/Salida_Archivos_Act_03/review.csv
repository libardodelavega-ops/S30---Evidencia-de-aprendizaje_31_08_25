1,Spain,"Ripe aromas of fig, blackberry and cassis are softened and sweetened by a slathering of oaky chocolate and vanilla. This is full, layered, intense and cushioned on the palate, with rich flavors of chocolaty black fruits and baking spices. A toasty, everlasting finish is heady but ideally balanced.

150925,Italy,"Many people feel Fiano represents southern Italyâs most promising white grape, and after tasting this rendition, who can argue? The flavor package is pineapple, citrus and wet stones.

150926,France,"Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeralâalmost too lightâbut thereâs a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.",CuvÃ©e Prestige,91,27.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,H.Germain
150927,Italy,"This classic example comes from a cru vineyard called Terre di Dora, which is named after the Mastroberardinosâ mother. They should all be proud of this one.
